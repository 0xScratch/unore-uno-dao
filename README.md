# Docs for UNO DAO Contracts 

### Vote Escrow Contract 

Put here the link to the initial source contracts from crv docs, add diff logs if any
Users deposit Uno tokens in this contract and get voting power on the basis of deposit amount and lock period. Uno token depositors in voting escrow can yield reward from VeUnoYielDistributor.

### veUNO Yield Distributor

The purpose of the contract is to provide inflationary token rewards to our community members for token locks upto 4 years. The rationale behind this implementation is that the insurance premium/fees generated by the protocol is being used to buyback and burn $UNO tokens over time in regular intevals. 

What it does? what are the key functions and params definitions?
Main invariant checks to be done? 
Specifically mention the onlyByOwnGov how its operated via contract, etc. 


### Resolver 

Its primarily a contract which allows us to allow epoch renewals for our existing veUNO holders providing a consistent state of returns in the form of APY. Even though this APY calculation is not very straightforward due to the decay implementation its a close enough approximation.

What it does? what are the key functions and params definitions?
Main invariant checks to be done? 

For each contracts try to write some basic invariant conditions which needs to be held true:
This can include function-level invariants that must hold with respect to the execution of the function (e.g., addition is commutative) or system-level invariants (e.g., the balance of a user cannot be greater than the total supply). We will specify the invariants in English and identify their pre-conditions (e.g., a parameter is within a given bound).


### Gnosis Safe Contracts 

Mention its purpose, version of contracts, usage of UI for latest version, etc. 

Used as a multisig, multiple EOA account sign proposal to execute transaction
Used in SSIP-SSRP to kill and pause pool, which deprecates functions.
Used as timelock address in VeUnoDaoYieldDistributor contract to
- Recover ERC20 token 
- Set yieldDuration 
- Toggle Greylist
- Toggle RewardNotifier
- Set pause 
- Set yield rate
- Set time lock 
version of contracts  >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
